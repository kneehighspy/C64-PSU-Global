For using this PSU, a suitable enclosure is required. It must not be connected to 230V while 115V mains is selected.

This PSU is designed for a low price at a decent comfort and for providing a PSU that can be switched between 230V and 115V mains.

The testing of Rev. 0 is still preliminary. The PSU was successfully tested with all ASSYs, that I have (250407, 250425, 250466, 250469). The panel meter current measurement worked, but the reading of all panelmeters was off, because those seem to have a bad quality. In Rev. 1 (yet to be released), the current measurement was dropped. The jumpers for bridging the current measurement should be replaced with short wire bridges in Rev. 0.

The changes in <b>Rev. 1</b> are the dropped current measurement. The freed space was used for wider copper tracks. The complete documentation, test documents are released now. The documentation of Rev. 0 will stay incomplete, most of the Rev. 1 documentation applies to Rev. 0 as well.

# Case
The case is designed. At 24°C room temperature the temperature measured above the transformer reached 44°C while powering an ASSY 250425 C64. This is not critical, since the critical temperature for PLA is 55°C-60°C. In case you need to operate the power supply in higher ambient temperatures, you should consider PETG or ABS for printing or install the PSU in a metal case.

The case was designed to fit the <a href="https://github.com/svenpetersen1965/Illuminated-Commmodore-logo">illuminated Commodore Logo</a> or <a href="https://github.com/svenpetersen1965/Illuminated-64-logo">64 Logo</a> (in my repository).

Since there is a version of the PSU for 230V only and one version that can be switched between 115V and 230V, which requires a mains voltage selector switch, there are two versions for the bottom shell.

# Prices
I have calculated the prices of May 2020.
Those prices do not include shipping fees and might differ from distributor to distributor. The prices of the items are from reichelt.de and tme.eu.

A 115V/230V type is 40,90€

A 230V only type is 35,11€

This does not incluse the 3D printed case, which might weigh 150g and take 12h to print.
